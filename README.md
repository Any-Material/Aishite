# FAQ

## Q. **App** is not showing anything!

If you ever encounter this issue, it means something is blocking your `http?s-request` to the server.<br>
Thankfully, recent change to our code allows debugging much easier.<br>
Thus please file an issue with debugger logs attached to.<br>
In addition, if you live in `South Korea`, chances are high that it's due to<br>
`South Korea` government's censorship against pornography.<br>
In order to bypass such, you have couple options.<br>

### 1. **VPN**

A `VPN` is a third-party service that instead makes request for you and send you back.<br>
It's definitely slow but safe, undetectable, but performance is very provider dependent.<br>

### 2. **DPI** (Deep Packet Inspection) **Bypasser**

A `DPI` bypasser splits packet to hid destination IP adress.<br>
It doesn't cost much request speed, very undetectable, but performance varies per software.<br>

## Q. Will there be **web version** given its powered by Electron?

Possibly, but nothing is confirmed.<br>
As such, there are some technical difficulties due to **Browser**s' inheirt restrictions.<br>
Though, its possible to avoid most of it, via backend and more.<br>
But it will require me to host a server which equals monthly fees.<br>
Throughout years I developed everyone was just lurking...<br>
why would I spend my money then?<br>
